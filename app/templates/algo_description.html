    <h1>Algorithm Description</h1>
    
    1. Data was crawled and scraped from the afltables, and validated by footywire data; data were then stored by game; AFLCA data were also scraped from the AFLCA website
    <br><br>
    2. Additional features were generated
    <br><br>
    3. Head to Head statistics for each pair of players onfield were created (i.e. each feature became player 1's features subtract player 2's features).
    <br><br>
    4. Features were normalised (x-mean)/sd within each game
    <br><br>
    5. Many regression models were attempted (tuned to best validation score hyperparameter combination), where each model predicted the difference in Brownlow votes received by each instance (pair of players) (i.e. 3, 2, 1, 0, -1, -2, -3)
    <br><br>
    Prediction
    <br><br>
    6. Each game was put through the model to get predicted differences in Brownlow votes.
    <br><br>
    -  <em>models attempted includes: Linear Regression (with regularisation), Binomial Regression, K-Nearest Neighbour Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, Extra Random Forest Regressor, AdaBoost Regressor, GradientBoost Regressor, XGB Regressor, LightGBM Regressor, CatBoost Regressor, Explainable Boosting Machine Regressor, Fully Connected Neural Network Regressor</em>
    <br><br>
    7. Each game's votes are tallied up and the player with the highest vote for the season is the predicted Brownlow Winner
    <ul>
    
        <li>within each pair, if the predicted difference in Brownlow votes is positive, then 1 point is given to 'player 1' in this pair and -1 points given to 'player 2'; otherwise, 1 point is given to 'player 2' and -1 point is given to player 1.</li>
        
        <li>The highest points-getter within a game gets 3 votes, the second gets 2 votes, the third gets 1 vote etc.</li>
        
    </ul>
    <br><br>
